## Intro

Amateur radio caught my eye in 2013 and I had no idea how unforgivingly difficult it would be for me muddling through every step of the way. There is an intense learning curve and oftentimes it takes me dozens of attempts before I get something even close to success. However it is really satisfying when you finally do make a breakthrough but be warned those are few and far between.
