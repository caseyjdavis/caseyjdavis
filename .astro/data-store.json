I found several examples online and decided to create my own version. This project uses pandoc to convert a markdown file to a pdf file. I also used weasyprint to add a css stylesheet to the pdf file. This is an example of how pandoc styled the file using a custom css stylesheet:\n\n![Resume Example](./resume-example.png)\n\n## Requirements\n\nI run an instance of Ubuntu 24.04 in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and used the following packages:\n\n- pandoc\n- weasyprint\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall requirements, I was able to do this easily in Ubuntu with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install pandoc weasyprint -y\n```\nThen clone this repository to your local machine\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/caseyjdavis/resume.git\n```\n## Customization\n\nEdit the resume.md file to include your information. You can also edit the resume-css-stylesheet.css file to change the styling of the pdf file. The beauty of this project is that you can easily version control your resume and make changes as needed.\n\n## Output\n\nOnce you are happy with your resume, run the following command to generate the pdf file:\n\n```bash\npandoc resume.md -o resume.pdf --pdf-engine=weasyprint --css resume-css-stylesheet.css\n```\n\n## Finished product\n\nPandoc will export a finished resume.pdf file in the current folder\n\n![Resume Output](./resume-output.png)","src/content/projects/markdown-resume/index.mdx","63da956d7ef3648f","markdown-resume/index.mdx","psappdeploytoolkit",{"id":32,"data":34,"body":38,"filePath":39,"digest":40,"legacyId":41,"deferredRender":21},{"title":35,"date":36,"description":37},"PSAppDeployToolkit",["Date","2016-06-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"Powershell App Deployment Toolkit","## Intro\r\n\r\nPSAppDeployToolkit is a versatile solution that streamlines and standardizes the process of software deployment, making it easier than ever to manage your IT environment.

Here are some steps to help migrate your existing configuration.\n\n## In-Place Upgrade or Swing Migration?\n\nAfter some careful consideration I settled on a Swing Migration to give me the most flexibility and backup in case something went wrong. Here's how Microsoft explains it:\n\n![Diagram of a Swing Server Migration](./stagingserver1.png)\n\n\n> For some customers, an in-place upgrade can impose a considerable risk to production in case there's an issue while upgrading and the server can't be rolled back. A single production server might also be impractical as the initial sync cycle might take multiple days, and during this time, no delta changes are processed.\n\n> The recommended method for these scenarios is to use a swing migration. You can use this method when you need to upgrade the Windows Server operating system. Additionally, you can use it when you plan to make substantial changes to your environment configuration, which need to be tested before they're pushed to production.\n\n## Backup Existing Configuration\n\nOpen Azure AD Connect on your existing server and you can export your working config for the second swing server\n\n![Export config from Azure AD Connect](./adconnect-exportsettings.png)\n\nIf you are using a fairly recent version of AD Connect it will export in JSON\n\n![Example JSON config](./adconnect-json.png)\n\n## Configuring TLS 1.2\n\nSetup a new Windows server VM where you will install Entra Connect. Before you can successfully install the application you must configure TLS on your server. Open Powershell ISE as Administrator and run this code on the swing server. This is writing 8 new entries to the Registry enabling TLS 1.2\n\n```powershell\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319'))\n{\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Force | Out-Null\n}\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SystemDefaultTlsVersions' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\n\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319'))\n{\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Force | Out-Null\n}\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SystemDefaultTlsVersions' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\n\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server'))\n{\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server' -Force | Out-Null\n}\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server' -Name 'Enabled' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server' -Name 'DisabledByDefault' -Value '0' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\n\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client'))\n{\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client' -Force | Out-Null\n}\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client' -Name 'Enabled' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client' -Name 'DisabledByDefault' -Value '0' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\n\nWrite-Host 'TLS 1.2 has been enabled.

Here are the steps to setup Cloudflare as an authenticator using Let's Encrypt for automatic SSL certificates for TrueNAS.\n\n## Edit User\n\nFirst you need to edit a user on your TrueNAS installation to have a valid e-mail address. Here I am editing the root user and putting in my e-mail. This is required to generate a certificate.\n\n![Add Cloudflare e-mail to local user](./edit-user.png)\n\n## Add ACME DNS Authenticator\n\nNext you add a DNS authenticator. In this case I am using Cloudflare because my domain is hosted there. You will need to generate a API token that allows you to edit DNS zones. Name the authenticator and paste your token in the API Token field. Note: If you use a token you do NOT have to enter your Cloudflare email and API Key.\n\n![Adding ACMD DNS Authenticator](./acme-dns-authenticator.png)\n\n## Add Certificate Signing Request\n\nHere you enter the details of the Certificate Signing Request you want to be visible on the certificate details. Fill in the required fields and save.\n\n![Generating a Certificate Signing Request in TrueNAS](./add-certificate-signing-request.png)\n\nOnce you have generated a CSR, then you turn around and click the wrench icon 🔧 in the web gui and that will open the wizard to generate the certificate.\n\n![Generating a Certificate Signing Request in TrueNAS](./add-certificate-signing-request%2002.png)\n\n## Generating a certificate\n\nFor the identifier I use `letsencrypt`, accept the Terms of Service, I set the certificate to renew every 30 days since this is local on my home lab. Make sure to select \"Production Directory\", select the domain and the authenticator and click Save.\n\n![Let's Encrypt Certificate for TrueNAS](./acme-certificate.png)\n\nA pop-up box will open with progress and you can see if the certificate was provisioned. This is what a successful DNS challenge will look like.\n\n![Let's Encrypt Certificate for TrueNAS](./dns-challenge.png)\n\n## Activating new certificate\n\nNow that you have generated a valid SSL cert you need to make sure the web gui in TrueNAS uses that certificate. Go to System Settings > General > GUI > Settings. In this menu you will select your new cert from the drop down box and make sure to click the HTTP > HTTPS Redirect. Click Save. The web interface will need to restart.\n\n![Activate Let's Encrypt Certificate for TrueNAS](./gui-settings.png)\n\n## Verifying SSL cert\n\nIf you have done everything correctly the certificate will be active, and you can click on the lock in your browser window to confirm the certificate has been issued by Let's Encrypt.\n\n![Verify Let's Encrypt Certificate for TrueNAS](./ssl-verified.png)","src/content/blog/truenas-letsencrypt-ssl/index.md",[142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149],"./edit-user.png","./acme-dns-authenticator.png","./add-certificate-signing-request.png","./add-certificate-signing-request 02.png","./acme-certificate.png","./dns-challenge.png","./gui-settings.png","./ssl-verified.png","148b81b3b7ca1264",{"html":152,"metadata":153},"\u003Ch2 id=\"intro\">Intro\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>TrueNAS has a built-in acme dns authenticator available via the web ui which means you can easily generate SSL certificates for the admin portal.
