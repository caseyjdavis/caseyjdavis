I found several examples online and decided to create my own version. This project uses pandoc to convert a markdown file to a pdf file. I also used weasyprint to add a css stylesheet to the pdf file. This is an example of how pandoc styled the file using a custom css stylesheet:\n\n![Resume Example](./resume-example.png)\n\n## Requirements\n\nI run an instance of Ubuntu 24.04 in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and used the following packages:\n\n- pandoc\n- weasyprint\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall requirements, I was able to do this easily in Ubuntu with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install pandoc weasyprint -y\n```\nThen clone this repository to your local machine\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/caseyjdavis/resume.git\n```\n## Customization\n\nEdit the resume.md file to include your information. You can also edit the resume-css-stylesheet.css file to change the styling of the pdf file. The beauty of this project is that you can easily version control your resume and make changes as needed.\n\n## Output\n\nOnce you are happy with your resume, run the following command to generate the pdf file:\n\n```bash\npandoc resume.md -o resume.pdf --pdf-engine=weasyprint --css resume-css-stylesheet.css\n```\n\n## Finished product\n\nPandoc will export a finished resume.pdf file in the current folder\n\n![Resume
