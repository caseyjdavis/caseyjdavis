In the world of Linux, this digital workshop is crafted through something seemingly mundane yet incredibly powerful: dotfiles.\r\nDotfiles are the secret sauce of Linux customization, hiding in plain sight within your home directory. Easily recognizable by their leading dot (.), these configuration files are the invisible architects of your computing environment. They control everything from your shell's behavior and terminal appearance to application settings and system preferences. What might look like simple text files are actually the blueprint of your personalized digital workspace.\r\nWhether you're a seasoned developer, a Linux enthusiast, or a curious newcomer, understanding dotfiles can transform how you interact with your computer. They're not just files—they're a reflection of your unique workflow, a testament to the incredible flexibility that makes Linux such a powerful operating system.\r\n\r\n## Github Repository\r\n\r\nGithub Link ➡️ [Casey's dotfiles](https://github.com/caseyjdavis/dotfiles)","src/content/projects/dotfiles/index.mdx","457783598079a5cd","dotfiles/index.mdx",true,"markdown-resume",{"id":21,"data":23,"body":27,"filePath":28,"digest":29,"legacyId":30,"deferredRender":20},{"title":24,"date":25,"description":26},"Markdown Resume",["Date","2025-03-12T00:00:00.000Z"],"Generate a clean resume from a markdown file","// import MdxPublicImage from \"@/components/MdxPublicImage.astro\";\r\n\r\n## Intro\r\n\r\nI needed to generate current resume and wanted to use Markdown to keep it simple and version controlled. I found several examples online and decided to create my own version. This project uses pandoc to convert a markdown file to a pdf file.

This is an example of how pandoc styled the file using a custom css stylesheet:\r\n\r\n![Resume Example](./resume-example.png)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nI run an instance of Ubuntu 24.04 in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and used the following packages:\r\n\r\n- pandoc\r\n- weasyprint\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall requirements, I was able to do this easily in Ubuntu with the following commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt install pandoc weasyprint -y\r\n```\r\nThen clone this repository to your local machine\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/caseyjdavis/resume.git\r\n```\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nEdit the resume.md file to include your information. You can also edit the resume-css-stylesheet.css file to change the styling of the pdf file. The beauty of this project is that you can easily version control your resume and make changes as needed.\r\n\r\n## Output\r\n\r\nOnce you are happy with your resume, run the following command to generate the pdf file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npandoc resume.md -o resume.pdf --pdf-engine=weasyprint --css resume-css-stylesheet.css\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Finished product\r\n\r\nPandoc will export a finished resume.pdf file in the current folder\r\n\r\n![Resume Output](./resume-output.png)","src/content/projects/markdown-resume/index.mdx","2fbee11231b1b8e9","markdown-resume/index.mdx","nv9p",{"id":31,"data":33,"body":37,"filePath":38,"digest":39,"legacyId":40,"deferredRender":20},{"title":34,"date":35,"description":36},"NV9P Amateur Radio",["Date","2017-02-20T00:00:00.000Z"],"My personal ham radio website","## Intro\r\n\r\nAmateur radio caught my eye in 2013 and I had no idea how unforgivingly difficult it would be for me muddling through every step of the way.

Here are some steps to help migrate your existing configuration.\r\n\r\n## In-Place Upgrade or Swing Migration?\r\n\r\nAfter some careful consideration I settled on a Swing Migration to give me the most flexibility and backup in case something went wrong. Here's how Microsoft explains it:\r\n\r\n![Diagram of a Swing Server Migration](./stagingserver1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n> For some customers, an in-place upgrade can impose a considerable risk to production in case there's an issue while upgrading and the server can't be rolled back. A single production server might also be impractical as the initial sync cycle might take multiple days, and during this time, no delta changes are processed.\r\n\r\n> The recommended method for these scenarios is to use a swing migration. You can use this method when you need to upgrade the Windows Server operating system. Additionally, you can use it when you plan to make substantial changes to your environment configuration, which need to be tested before they're pushed to production.\r\n\r\n## Backup Existing Configuration\r\n\r\nOpen Azure AD Connect on your existing server and you can export your working config for the second swing server\r\n\r\n![Export config from Azure AD Connect](./adconnect-exportsettings.png)\r\n\r\nIf you are using a fairly recent version of AD Connect it will export in JSON\r\n\r\n![Example JSON config](./adconnect-json.png)\r\n\r\n## Configuring TLS 1.2\r\n\r\nSetup a new Windows server VM where you will install Entra Connect. Before you can successfully install the application you must configure TLS on your server. Open Powershell ISE as Administrator and run this code on the swing server. This is writing 8 new entries to the Registry enabling TLS 1.2\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319'))\r\n{\r\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Force | Out-Null\r\n}\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SystemDefaultTlsVersions' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\n\r\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319'))\r\n{\r\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Force | Out-Null\r\n}\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SystemDefaultTlsVersions' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\n\r\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server'))\r\n{\r\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server' -Force | Out-Null\r\n}\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server' -Name 'Enabled' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Server' -Name 'DisabledByDefault' -Value '0' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\n\r\nIf (-Not (Test-Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client'))\r\n{\r\n    New-Item 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client' -Force | Out-Null\r\n}\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client' -Name 'Enabled' -Value '1' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.2\\Client' -Name 'DisabledByDefault' -Value '0' -PropertyType 'DWord' -Force | Out-Null\r\n\r\nWrite-Host 'TLS 1.2 has been enabled.

This setup is part of my homelab, where I experiment with containerization and various technologies.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore starting, ensure you have the following:\r\n\r\n- **NFS Server**: I’m using TrueNAS on an HP EliteDesk.\r\n- **Docker Host**: My Docker server runs on a separate HP EliteDesk.\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Export an NFS Share\r\n\r\nBegin by exporting an NFS share from your NFS server. In my case, I exported the directory `/mnt/pool0/nfs/docker-volumes` from TrueNAS. \r\n\r\nNext, SSH into your Docker server and mount the NFS share. For example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo mount -t nfs4 lilmt.qth.nv9p.com:/mnt/pool0/nfs/docker-volumes /mnt/nfs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce mounted, create a directory for Uptime Kuma’s persistent data:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir -p /mnt/nfs/uptimekuma-data\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis directory will store all the container’s data.\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Create a Volume in Portainer\r\n\r\nI use Portainer to manage my Docker containers. To create a volume:\r\n\r\n1. Access the Portainer web interface.\r\n2. Navigate to **Volumes** and click **Add Volume**.\r\n3. Fill in the NFS server details, including the mount point (`/mnt/nfs/uptimekuma-data`), and click **Create the volume**.\r\n\r\n![Create NFS volume via Portainer](./create-volume.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Deploy the Uptime Kuma Container\r\n\r\nNow, create the Uptime Kuma container:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the **Containers** section in Portainer and click **Add Container**.\r\n2. Name the container and use the official Uptime Kuma image: `louislam/uptime-kuma`.\r\n3. Under **Network**, map port `3000` on both the host and container.\r\n4. Scroll to the **Volumes** section and map the NFS volume:\r\n    - Set the container path to `/app/data`.\r\n    - Select the NFS volume created earlier.\r\n\r\nFinally, click **Deploy the container**.\r\n\r\n![Create Uptimekuma Container in Docker](./create-container.png)\r\n\r\n![Add NFS volume to container](./add-nfs-volume.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 4: Access Uptime Kuma\r\n\r\nOnce the container is running, navigate to your Docker server’s IP address on port `3000` to access Uptime Kuma. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://docker-01.qth.nv9p.com:3000\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see the Uptime Kuma interface, ready for configuration.\r\n\r\n![Monitoring website via Uptime Kuma as a docker container](./uptime-kuma.png)\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nBy leveraging NFSv4 for persistent storage, you can efficiently manage Uptime Kuma in a Docker container.
