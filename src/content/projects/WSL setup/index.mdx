## What is Windows Subsystem for Linux?

WSL is a powerful compatibility layer developed by Microsoft that allows users to run native Linux command-line tools and utilities directly on Windows, without the overhead of traditional virtual machines or dual-boot setups. It provides a lightweight, integrated experience that bridges the gap between Windows and Linux ecosystems.

Whether you're a software engineer, a system administrator, or a tech enthusiast, Windows Subsystem for Linux represents a pivotal advancement in operating system interoperability, making cross-platform work more accessible and efficient than ever before.

## Automated setup using Ansible

Here is my Github repository that you clone into a fresh WSL install that will provision the virtual machine with packages, settings, locales, etc. It will clone my dotfiles as well and leave you with a completely up to date Ubuntu instance running Oh-My-Zsh, vim, npm and several other Linux tools.
